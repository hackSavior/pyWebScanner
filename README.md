# Python Network Scanner

This Python project demonstrates network scanning capabilities using the `python-nmap` library. <br>It provides an interface to the Nmap security scanner, allowing for host discovery, port scanning, service/version detection, OS detection, script scanning, and integration with Nmap's output.

## Features

- Perform port scanning on target hosts, including TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols.
- Discover hosts on a network through host discovery scans.
- Retrieve information about services running on open ports, including service names and version details.
- Detect the operating system of a target host.
- Execute Nmap scripts against target hosts for various tasks, such as vulnerability detection and service enumeration.
- Access and parse Nmap's XML output for detailed scan results.
- Flexibility and customization options to configure scan parameters and process scan results programmatically.
